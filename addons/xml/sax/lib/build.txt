The binary dynamic libraries
were obtained as follows:


libexpat.dll was built 

- from sources in Expat-2.0.0 Windows setup
- using MS VS 2005
- with converted older project files
- after only changing a single line of code:

    file: Source\lib\expat_external.h
    line 38:  #define XMLCALL __stdcall


libexpat.dylib was borrowed from Expat-2.0.0 package
    at http://www.wsanchez.net/


libexpat.so was built from Expat-2.0.0 sources
on Red Hat v8 Linux, x86.


Binaries for other platforms can be obtained as
described at http://expat.sourceforge.net/
