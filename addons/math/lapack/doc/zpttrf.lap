ZPTTRF computes the factorization of a complex Hermitian positive
definite tridiagonal matrix A.

If the subdiagonal elements of A are supplied in the array E, the
factorization has the form A = L*D*L**H, where D is diagonal and L is
unit lower bidiagonal; if the superdiagonal elements of A are
supplied, it has the form A = U**H*D*U, where U is unit upper
bidiagonal.


Arguments
=========

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

D       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
        On entry, the n diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix
        A.  On exit, the n diagonal elements of the diagonal matrix
        D from the L*D*L**H factorization of A.

E       (input/output) COMPLEX*16 array, dimension (N-1)
        On entry, the (n-1) off-diagonal elements of the tridiagonal
        matrix A.  On exit, the (n-1) off-diagonal elements of the
        unit bidiagonal factor L or U from the factorization of A.

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value

        > 0:  if INFO = i, the leading minor of order i is not
        positive definite; if i < N, the factorization could
        not be completed, while if i = N, the factorization was
        completed, but D(N) = 0.
