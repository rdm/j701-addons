DLAED6 computes the positive or negative root (closest to the origin)
of
                 z(1)        z(2)        z(3) f(x) =   rho + ---------
+ ---------- + ---------
                d(1)-x      d(2)-x      d(3)-x
      otherwise it is between d(1) and d(2)


This routine will be called by DLAED4 when necessary. In most cases,
the root sought is the smallest in magnitude, though it might not be
in some extremely rare situations.
