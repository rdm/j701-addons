DLAIC1 applies one step of incremental condition estimation in its
simplest version:

Let x, twonorm(x) = 1, be an approximate singular vector of an j-by-j
lower triangular matrix L, such that

         twonorm(L*x) = sest

Then DLAIC1 computes sestpr, s, c such that

the vector

                [ s*x ]

         xhat = [  c  ]

is an approximate singular vector of

                [ L     0  ]

         Lhat = [ w' gamma ]

in the sense that

         twonorm(Lhat*xhat) = sestpr.


Depending on JOB, an estimate for the largest or smallest singular
value is computed.


Note that [s c]' and sestpr**2 is an eigenpair of the system

    diag(sest*sest, 0) + [alpha  gamma] * [ alpha ]

                                          [ gamma ]


where  alpha =  x'*w.
