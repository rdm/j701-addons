DSYGST reduces a real symmetric-definite generalized eigenproblem to
standard form.

If ITYPE = 1, the problem is A*x = lambda*B*x,

and A is overwritten by inv(U**T)*A*inv(U) or inv(L)*A*inv(L**T)

If ITYPE = 2 or 3, the problem is A*B*x = lambda*x or

B*A*x = lambda*x, and A is overwritten by U*A*U**T or L**T*A*L.

B must have been previously factorized as U**T*U or L*L**T by DPOTRF.


Arguments
=========

ITYPE   (input) INTEGER
        = 1: compute inv(U**T)*A*inv(U) or inv(L)*A*inv(L**T);

        = 2 or 3: compute U*A*U**T or L**T*A*L.

UPLO    (input) CHARACTER

        = 'U':  Upper triangle of A is stored and B is factored as
        U**T*U;
        = 'L':  Lower triangle of A is stored and B is factored as
        L*L**T.

N       (input) INTEGER
        The order of the matrices A and B.  N >= 0.

A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
        On entry, the symmetric matrix A.  If UPLO = 'U', the leading
        N-by-N upper triangular part of A contains the upper
        triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly lower
        triangular part of A is not referenced.  If UPLO = 'L', the
        leading N-by-N lower triangular part of A contains the lower
        triangular part of the matrix A, and the strictly upper
        triangular part of A is not referenced.

        On exit, if INFO = 0, the transformed matrix, stored in the
        same format as A.

LDA     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

B       (input) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDB,N)
        The triangular factor from the Cholesky factorization of B,
        as returned by DPOTRF.

LDB     (input) INTEGER
        The leading dimension of the array B.  LDB >= max(1,N).

INFO    (output) INTEGER
        = 0:  successful exit

        < 0:  if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
