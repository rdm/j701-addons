ZLAED8 merges the two sets of eigenvalues together into a single
sorted set.  Then it tries to deflate the size of the problem. There
are two ways in which deflation can occur:  when two or more
eigenvalues are close together or if there is a tiny element in the Z
vector.  For each such occurrence the order of the related secular
equation problem is reduced by one.
