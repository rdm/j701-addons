JOD source dictionaries in (jodsource.zip) can be set up in two ways:

1) Run the J script ~addons/general/jodsource/jodsourcesetup.ijs

   This is the recommended method.  (jodsourcesetup.ijs) has been
   checked on Windows j6.02, j7.01 and linux and Mac j7.01 32 bit systems.
   NOTE: It can take a minute or so to run.

The ctags and etags programs (hereinafter collectively referred to

file allows these items to be quickly and easily located by a text

which an index entry is available (or, alternatively, the index
entry created for that object).

options for the form of the words used, and verbs to convert a script
in alpha form to a script in J primitives so there is no execution
time penalty.

general/scriptdoc 1.0.15 
scriptdoc
Scripts are documented in comment lines (i.e. lines
beginning with NB.). Multi-line comments are consecutive
lines beginning with NB. with no break.

The first line of a multi-line comment may be used
for summary documentation of the script.


1. The first line in the script is a comment line describing the script, i.e

   NB. script description

2. Global definitions produced by the script are preceded by
one or more comment lines. The first such comment line has
the form:

   NB.*name type description

where type is one of:
        v verb
        a  adverb
        c  conjunction
        n  noun

After this first comment line, all subsequent comment lines
without a break are assumed to be part of the description
for the definition.

The * should not be given after the NB. unless it begins
a new definition.

Conventionally, the second such line may be a "form" statement
describing the usage of the definition, e.g.

   form:  calendar year [,months]

Other lines include an "example" statement

   example: calendar 1998 5

3. Other NB. comment lines in the script are ignored.
